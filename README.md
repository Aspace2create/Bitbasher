# Progress So far...

The Bitbasher Pixel Art Kitbasher is an exciting new tool for creating and editing pixel art. It is currently under development and has made significant progress in several key areas.

One of the main focuses of the development so far has been creating a custom file format. This custom format allows for greater flexibility and control when working with pixel art, and the team is currently at 50% completion for this aspect of the project.

Another important area of focus has been creating all necessary commands for image editing. This includes a variety of tools and options for manipulating and adjusting the pixels in an image. The team is currently at 40% completion for this aspect of the project.

The user interface is also an important part of the project, and the team is currently at 20% completion for this aspect. The goal is to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to access all of the tools and options available.

Finally, the team is working on adding sprites to the tool. So far, at least 10 sprites have been added, and the team is currently at 2% completion for this aspect of the project.

The tool also includes a set of commands for editing images, including the ability to delete highlighted objects, move objects in different directions, zoom in and out, and bring objects forward or back in the image.

Overall, the Bitbasher Pixel Art Kitbasher is shaping up to be a powerful and versatile tool for pixel artists, and the development team is working hard to bring it to completion as soon as possible. With the progress so far, the tool looks promising and has the potential to be a great addition to any pixel artist's toolset.

# features to be included...

Layer support: Adding support for layers would allow users to work on different parts of an image separately, and then combine them later. This can make it easier to make changes and revisions, and also allows for more complex images.

Animation support: Adding support for animation would allow users to create animated pixel art, which can be used in games, videos, and other projects. This feature could include tools for creating and editing animation frames, as well as the ability to preview the animation.

Customizable color palette: A customizable color palette would allow users to create their own set of colors to use when working on an image. This can be particularly useful for artists who have a specific color scheme in mind for a project.

Brush and eraser tools: Brush and eraser tools would allow users to create more organic and freeform shapes, which can be useful for creating detailed images.

Text tool: A text tool would allow users to add text to an image, which can be useful for creating labels, captions, or other types of text-based content.

Symmetry mode: A symmetry mode would allow users to draw symmetrical shapes and patterns, which can be useful for creating certain types of pixel art, such as characters and backgrounds.

Import and export options: Adding import and export options would allow users to work on images in other software and then import them into Bitbasher for further editing, or export their work to share with others.
